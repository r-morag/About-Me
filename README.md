# Hi I'm Roee

Welcome to my profile! I'm a current graduate student looking to break into the world of data analytics/science!

I've interned as a data scientist at Candlestick Capital, a hedge fund in New York City.

I've also worked on research with various departments at my university, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I worked with mechanical engineering faculty to simplify the Fanger PMV model for thermal comfort. In short, I used student survey data to predict the thermal comfort in classes using more readily available figures (such as temperature and humidity).


Take a look at my projects and some cool stuff I'm working on!
