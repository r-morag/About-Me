# Hi I'm Roee

Welcome to my profile! I'm a current graduate student looking to break into the world of data analytics/science!

I've interned at Candlestick Capital, a hedge fund in New York City - as well as done research on my own campus at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

Take a look at my projects and some cool stuff I'm working on.
